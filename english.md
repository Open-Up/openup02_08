I give some optional text you can read before coming, and we will see what you think about the theme !

Todays theme is "Artificial Intelligence, a danger for the human race ?"

To prepare, you can ask yourself these questions :

- Do I think humans will be able to develop a super intelligence ?
- Do I think this super intelligence will be bad for us ?

Also, you might remember cultural products about Artificial Intelligence (movies, books, etc... )

I give you some links, if you want to document yourself :
